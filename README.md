# CP1300-MineSweeper-Game-in-Java

##Task:
You are to plan and then code the “True/False Game” as described by the information provided below. The assignment is worth 30% of your overall grade for CP1300. You are expected to work the assignment based on the following coding requirements and expected gameplay features.

##Gameplay Features:
The “True/False game” is played on a 2D board of cells. The content of each cell is initially unknown by the player. The game is played by revealing the contents of each cell. A cell might be empty or contain a single flag. There are two types of flag: a true­flag, and a false­flag. A true­flag is a “treasure” the player wants to find, whereas a false­flag must never be revealed. Finding a false­flag causes the player to immediately lose the game. The player only wins the game if they reveal all cells except those that contain false­flags.

When a new game starts the board is initialised with a number of randomly placed flags. The number of flags depends on the difficulty level and the size of the board. So after the board is setup, some cells will be empty and some will contain a flag. There are 3 difficulty levels: “easy”, “medium”, and “hard”. The board size is determined by a row value between 4 ­ 10 inclusive and a column value between 4 ­ 10 inclusive.
